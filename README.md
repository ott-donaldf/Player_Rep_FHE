# Universal Player Reputation System

The **Universal Player Reputation System** is a cutting-edge, cross-game reputation system that leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. By utilizing FHE encryption, this innovative platform allows for the secure and private calculation of player reputations based on their game behavior while ensuring that their sensitive information remains protected. This ensures that players can engage in gaming without the fear of having their personal data compromised.

## The Pain Point

In today's gaming landscape, player behavior can significantly impact the overall gaming experience. Malicious activities, such as cheating or toxic behavior, can ruin the experience for others. However, current methods of reputation assessment often require revealing sensitive player data, leaving them vulnerable to privacy breaches and exploitation. Furthermore, without a reliable reputation system, good players suffer the consequences of bad actors.

## FHE: The Solution

**Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** provides a robust solution to these challenges. By allowing computations to be performed directly on encrypted data, our system calculates reputation scores without ever needing to expose sensitive player information. This implementation uses Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, to ensure high performance while safeguarding player privacy. 

With FHE, we can conduct thorough analysis of player behaviors—including instances of cheating or unsportsmanlike conduct—without compromising their individual privacy. This leads to a fairer gaming environment where players can enjoy their experience without the fear of judgment or exposure.

## Core Functionalities

### Key Features:
- **FHE Encrypted Player Behavior Tracking:** All player actions are securely recorded and encrypted.
- **Homomorphic Reputation Scoring:** Reputation scores are computed on encrypted data, ensuring privacy and accuracy.
- **Clean Gaming Environment:** By identifying and purging malicious actors from games, we create a healthier gaming ecosystem.
- **Enhanced Player Experience:** Good players receive rewards and better experiences based on their reputational standing.
- **Personal Reputation Dashboard:** Players have access to their reputation scores and detailed API documentation for developers.

- **Zama SDK (zama-fhe SDK)**
- **Node.js**
- **Web3.js**
- **Solidity**
- **Hardhat / Foundry**
- **React** (for the front-end dashboard)

## Installation Instructions

Assuming you have already downloaded the project, follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Install Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website.
   
2. **Install Hardhat**: If you haven't done this already:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the root directory of the project and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command will fetch all required libraries, including Zama's FHE libraries.

4. **Initial Setup**: Ensure you have the necessary environment variables set up, if applicable (such as API keys, etc.).

## Compiling and Running the Project

Once your environment is set up, you can compile, test, and run the project. Use the following commands:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests**: To ensure everything works as intended, run:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the Smart Contract**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
   ```

### Example Code Snippet

Here’s a sample snippet demonstrating how to calculate a player's reputation:

```solidity
// Player_Rep_FHE.sol

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

contract PlayerRep {
    mapping(address => uint256) public reputationScores;

    // This function securely increments the reputation score based on FHE calculations
    function updateReputation(address player, uint256 scoreChange) internal {
        reputationScores[player] += scoreChange;
    }
}
```

This snippet is a simplified version showing how player reputation scores can be updated securely.
